## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pcc-est-v5.git
   cd pcc-est-v5
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:
   ```
   PORT=5001
   ```

### Running the Application

Start both the frontend and backend concurrently:

```bash
npm start
```

Or run them separately:

```bash
# Frontend only

## Claude AI Optimization

This repository includes a specialized `.claude` directory structure designed to help Claude AI better understand, navigate, and work with the codebase. This structure provides context, patterns, and historical information that enhances Claude's ability to provide assistance.

### Memory Anchors

The codebase utilizes special memory anchor comments that help Claude precisely reference specific sections of code:

```javascript
// CLAUDE-ANCHOR: section-name uuid
// Description of the code section
```

These anchors provide semantic structure and identifiers that make it easier for Claude to understand and navigate the codebase.

### Benefits of the Claude Structure

- **Enhanced Code Understanding**: Provides Claude with comprehensive knowledge about component relationships, data flows, and code intentions
- **Pattern Recognition**: Documents established patterns for consistent code generation
- **Error Handling**: Catalogs common errors and their solutions for faster debugging
- **Historical Context**: Preserves knowledge about why certain decisions were made

For more information about the Claude optimization structure, see the [.claude/README.md](./.claude/README.md) file.

## Data Sources

The application uses historical price data from Yahoo Finance for cryptocurrencies. Data is stored in CSV format in the `data/crypto_data/` directory.
